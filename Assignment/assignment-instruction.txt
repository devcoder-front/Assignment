About Us:

We're an exciting, high growth startup with tens of thousands of users and a product that's making an impact.
We offer LONG term work, REGULARLY scheduled pay raises, and LOTS of technical/creative freedom.

Task Overview:
We are seeking an experienced Angular developer who can BUILD things. Talk is cheap - we want to see how you think, code and approach problems.

Please track the time you spend on this trial as we will compensate you at your hourly rate IF hired.

We will not be using any work from your trial in any of our products. All candidates will be completing this same task so we can assess a best fit.


Instructions: The instructions below are deliberately short in order to see how you take on the challenge. Do as much or as little as you please, it's all a part of your assessment.

Please create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI and implement Mockup.png.

You are free to struture the project and code however you like. You can find the assets in the assets directory. 

NOTE:
1. I'd like to see the mockup be responsive. This is very important that you have the skills to make UI responsive across different devices and screens.
2. You don't need to use a different image per tile. Use the default image provided in the assets directory.

When finished, please send a url to a public Git repo where the code can be accessed. I will be cloning the repo and running the app.

If I like what I see, I will ask you to chat and you'll most likely get the job at that point.

Any other questions related to the task? Please message through UpWork.

Best of luck and hope to chat with you!
Mark
